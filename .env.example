# RAG Performance Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values based on your needs

# === RAG Performance Settings ===
# Chunk size for document splitting (words)
# Smaller = faster search, less context per chunk
# Larger = more context, slower search
# Recommended: 120-200
RAG_CHUNK_SIZE=150

# Overlap between chunks (words)
# Prevents context loss at boundaries
# Recommended: 20-40
RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP=30

# Default number of results to return
# Lower = faster responses
# Higher = more context but slower
# Recommended: 2-3 for production
RAG_DEFAULT_K=3

# Maximum number of results allowed
# Caps the k parameter in API calls
# Recommended: 5-10
RAG_MAX_K=10

# Query timeout in seconds
# Prevents hanging queries
# Recommended: 3-5 for production
RAG_QUERY_TIMEOUT=5

# Maximum context length to send to LLM (characters)
# Lower = faster LLM responses
# Higher = more context but slower
# Recommended: 1500-2000
RAG_MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=2000

# Enable query result caching
# true = repeated queries are instant
# false = no caching (not recommended)
RAG_ENABLE_CACHING=true

# Number of query results to cache
# Higher = more memory but better hit rate
# Recommended: 50-200
RAG_CACHE_SIZE=100

# Minimum relevance score threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Higher = only very relevant results
# Lower = more results but less relevant
# Recommended: 0.3-0.4
RAG_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.3

# === Additional Settings ===
# Port for backend server
PORT=5001

# Enable model warmup (can slow startup)
ENABLE_MODEL_WARMUP=false

# Maximum concurrent requests
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=10

# Request timeout (seconds)
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300

# === Preset Configurations ===
# Uncomment one of these blocks to use preset values

# FAST PRESET (Speed priority)
# RAG_CHUNK_SIZE=120
# RAG_DEFAULT_K=2
# RAG_QUERY_TIMEOUT=3
# RAG_MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=1500
# RAG_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.35

# BALANCED PRESET (Default - already set above)
# RAG_CHUNK_SIZE=150
# RAG_DEFAULT_K=3
# RAG_QUERY_TIMEOUT=5
# RAG_MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=2000
# RAG_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.3

# ACCURATE PRESET (Quality priority)
# RAG_CHUNK_SIZE=200
# RAG_DEFAULT_K=5
# RAG_QUERY_TIMEOUT=10
# RAG_MAX_CONTEXT_LENGTH=3000
# RAG_MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE=0.25
